WELCOME!!! 


My name is Farid Virani
This is my 2nd project for GA


The goal of the project was to build a full stack app. My app, faridcleaners, gets you dry cleaning services at your conviences from one click away. We do offer drop off services as well for those with busy work life 

To install this, fork and clone from the repo, start the server from the console by typing in npm run dev. To open up the webpage, type http://localhost:3000 into the navbar.

User Accounts: 

The user can sign up with their name, email and password 
if the user has signed up, they're able to login
Once the user has logged in, they will be rerouted back to the home page, where the user is able to look at the different services offered 

Below are screenshots of my wireframe

Latest updates below: 


All the intended routes such as GET and ejs pages are working as normal. More updates are needed to access a database, which will help users sign up and login. Users will be able to pick and choose what services they need. Users are able to leave a review. I will be adding more and updating along the way. More styling is on the way.
