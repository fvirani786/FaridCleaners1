WELCOME!!! 


My name is Farid Virani
This is my 2nd project for GA


The goal of the project was to build a full stack app. My app, faridcleaners, gets you dry cleaning services at your conviences from one click away. We do offer drop off services as well for those with busy work life 

To install locally, simply fork and clone the repo, install dependancies(listed below), and startup the server from your console with npm run dev. To navigate to the app, open your browser and type http://localhost:3000 into the navbar. Alternatively, you can also now use my live link to access the page from any device or location

User Accounts: 

The user can sign up with their name, email and password 
if the user has signed up, they're able to login
Once the user has logged in, they will be rerouted back to the home page, where the user is able to look at the different services offered

Step by Step Sign up/Log in 

1) User will be redirected to Home page where they can either click the link to log in or if it's users first time, they will click the sign up page

2A) if user is in Log in page, User will enter in username and password. That will redirect them to home page to look at the various services offered

2B) if user is in sign up page, User will enter in; first & last name, user name, email address, and password. Once that is finished, user will be signed up and directed to homepage 

3) User will be on the home page to view the many services offered
